# PokeCLI
### *A Pokédex in your terminal*

## Introduction
PokéCLI is a small project that I started to get familiar with TUI apps. It uses [BubbleTea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) for the UI and [Cobra](https://cobra.dev/) for the CLI commands.


## Building
I'm not shipping any releases at the moment, but if you would like to use this tool yourself, just [install Go](https://go.dev/dl/), clone the repository, navigate to the directory in your terminal and type `go build .`. Quick warning: Resizing the terminal on Windows is not supported. For the best possible experience, use MacOS. I have not tested this on Linux.

## Developing
This project is a small passion project I've been working on, but if you'd like to improve it, feel free to submit a PR and I'll gladly take a look at it :)
